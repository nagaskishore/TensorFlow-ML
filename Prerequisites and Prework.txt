1) Mastery of intro-level algebra. You should be comfortable with variables and coefficients, linear equations, graphs of functions, and histograms. (Familiarity with more advanced math concepts such as logarithms and derivatives is helpful, but not required.)

2) Proficiency in programming basics, and some experience coding in Python. Programming exercises in Machine Learning Crash Course are coded in Python using TensorFlow. No prior experience with TensorFlow is required, but you should feel comfortable reading and writing Python code that contains basic programming constructs, such as function definitions/invocations, lists and dicts, loops, and conditional expressions.

3) Getting Started with pandas

The programming exercises in Machine Learning Crash Course use the pandas library for manipulating data sets. If you're unfamiliar with pandas, we recommend completing the Quick Introduction to pandas tutorial, which illustrates the key pandas features used in the exercises.

4) Low-Level TensorFlow Basics

The programming exercises in Machine Learning Crash Course use TensorFlow's high-level tf.estimator API to configure models. If you're interested in building TensorFlow models from scratch, complete these tutorials:

TensorFlow Hello World: "Hello World" coded in low-level TensorFlow.
TensorFlow Programming Concepts: A walkthrough of the fundamental components of a TensorFlow application: tensors, operations, graphs, and sessions.
Creating and Manipulating Tensors: A quick primer on tensors: the central abstraction in TensorFlow programming. Also provides a refresher on matrix addition and multiplication in linear algebra.
